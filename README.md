# B2B Fake Invoice Payment Prevention using Verifiable Credentials

## Introduction(Problem)

This repository provides a solution to combat B2B fake invoice payment fraud by leveraging Verifiable Credentials. B2B invoice fraud is a prevalent problem where businesses fall victim to fraudulent invoices, resulting in financial losses. Verifiable Credentials offer a secure and tamper-proof way to verify the authenticity of invoices, suppliers, and payment details.

## Solution

### What Are Verifiable Credentials?

Verifiable Credentials are digital attestations that represent statements made by an issuer about a subject. In our context, these credentials are used to confirm the authenticity of invoices and the legitimacy of suppliers, thereby reducing the risk of fraudulent payments.

## How It Works

1. **Credential Issuance**: The supplier or service provider issues a Verifiable Credential that contains details about the invoice, the products or services delivered, and the payment request.

2. **Verification**: The receiving business, as the verifier, checks the validity of the Verifiable Credential. This can be done by verifying the digital signature of the issuer and ensuring it was issued using a trusted and secure system.

3. **Invoice Validation**: The verifier validates the invoice details against the information in the Verifiable Credential. Any discrepancies can be flagged for further investigation.

4. **Payment Authorization**: Payment is authorized only after successful verification and validation of the Verifiable Credential. This helps prevent payments for fake invoices.

5. **Blockchain Integration (Optional)**: For added security, this system can be integrated with a blockchain to store and timestamp Verifiable Credentials. This enhances the audit trail and ensures the immutability of records.
